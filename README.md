# RopstamApp

 The app is not entriely completed but you can still fetch data and display it.<br />
 You can do CRUD operations on this app.<br />
 I have added a DataBase folder in the BE (Backend) file and you can insert that into your mysql database.<br />
 After the insertion just login to the application with email of test@email.com and password is 123<br />
 You can create your own email but you would have to provide your email and password for the gmail emailer  in the env file in BE (Backend) folder to be able to send  <br />   proper emails using this application. You can create new users using this <br />
 Start the application by first running the backend by simply npm install and npm start and then doing the same with FE (frontend folder as well)
